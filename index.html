    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is Paul Ngoni Seremu and much a programming enthusiast. Born in a family of 5, I'm the oldest son and currently I'm studying front-end dev at Maven Academy and so amped to get through the course and come out with cool new skills in programming. In terms of lifestyle, I'm quite friendly (I would like to think), and love meeting people of different backgrounds and learning from different sources to broaden my knowledge in life, generally. I love tech so much that it influences most of my personal interest in life and have a huge impact on my movie favorites.</p>
